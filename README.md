# Hi there! Welcome to my README. My name is Alex Giannini and I have developed a Weather Application. When in use, the user is able to search for any city and is able to view the current temperature, humidity percentage, an image representing the current weather conditions, and a UV index/number. The search result also produces a five day weather forecast, also displaying the temperature, humidity percentage, and images representing the weather for the next 5 days. Lastly, the user can view their search history and select a city within the search history to view the current weather and 5 day forecast for the selected city. Hope you enjoy!
